1. To collab you need to make new repo on the other collaborators computer and merge them

2.develpers use branches to keep their work organized 

3. git is a command line used to allow them to track and manage changes to the code. Github is a web based platform to store repos. 

4. it is wrong becaause git add . should be first. The correct command line should be 
git add .
git commit -m "saving work"
git push
